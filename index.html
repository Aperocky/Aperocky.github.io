            On the occasion as I was spending my free time behind a computer sitting
            behind a table in the class I TAed in. I realized in search that Github
            has the ability to host webpages. A little bit disappointing in that the
            webpages are static and no php code can be used, it's nonetheless a good
            exercise of HTML, CSS and JS. So here I am, Welcome to my Github Page.

            I have only recently begin writing websites as a part of my project
            required. In the process of gathering the skill needed to complete the
            website I have myself indulged in the great fun that is website building.
            I was an avid constructor with lego for much of my career (that is to say,
            School), and the process of creating a website feels EXACTLY like that!
            If I have to specify the differences, it would be that there are way
            more different kind of pieces and an infinite amount of each of them
            that I could utilize. It's even better than java/python where you have
            to build the pieces yourself, which is a time consuming process, and
            face the prospect that they don't work. You begin standing on the
            dump ground of all pieces and you build them up however you like.

            Programming is an awe inspiring task to me, contrary to many people
            who find the opposite. It's awe draws from the feeling that you get
            standing on giants. In math, Euler and Gauss has laid out much of the
            foundation of the subject, and following mathematicians live in the
            framework that they have created. It's the same in programming, and
            especially in web building where forerunners have built the tools
            so we can work in the easy. Recall the time that Paul Allen punched
            cards on the airplane before he had to show up to present that program.
            Yes, <i>punched cards</i>! Gone were the days where programming meant
            calling transistors one by one, and gone because of those great people
            that spent their time creating the enormous framework of languages,
            compilers, libraries and hardware.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one of two things that I kind of regret in my life is that I have
            not taken up programming earlier. Now my brain is maxing out, my ability to
            learn becomes slower. But only so much, I appreciate each moment that
            programming has brought to me, rejoicing in the fact that I live in the
            best time possible in entire human history.
